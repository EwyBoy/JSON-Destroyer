# JSON-Destroyer

Json destoyer is a lib that can be easily included into your mod(more on this later) that allows the creation of modeles for items, blocks and fluids in minecraft 1.8 and higher without the need for json files.
It is very simple to impliment and use and does not require a core mod. It should have no peformace drain over just using standard json files(It may even be quicker).

# More info

I made this to help me udpdate TechReborn to 1.8 and not have the pain of making loads of json files. But it seamed that other people wanted to use it, so here is a more refined version that is easy to use.

If you fell like something is missing or broken please open an issue and I will take a look.

Also if you would like to help the project feel free to open a PR.
